# Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game!

## User Stories

The following user stories directed my development process:
  - As player x, I want to click in a box so that an x appears on my turn.
  - As a winner, I want to see a message on the screen so that I know I won.
  - As an account holder, I want to be able to sign in to my account.
  - As an account holder, I want to be able to see how many games I have played so that I can track progress.
  - As an account holder, I want to be able to change my password to protect my privacy.

  ## List of Technologies

  - Atom
  - Bootstrap
  - Javascript
  - HTML

## Development Process

My approach to this project was to start with the user authentication and then incorporate parts of the API and game engine congruently.  This method seemed like it would be the best way to fully create a piece of the game before moving on to the next.  After establishing both the game engine and the API for game actions, I moved on to retrieving the game statistics, where I was able to fully confirm whether the API requests were working since the accuracy of the retrieved statistics depended on the API requests functioning properly. As a result, I caught some mistakes and was able to fix them.

## Unsolved Problems

In the future, I would hope to be able to share results of the number of wins or losses for player x or o specifically.  I'd also like to be able to offer more interesting styling to enhance the user's experience. I'd like to be able to organize the code for this game more logically, efficiently, and neatly.  Upon starting this project, I would have liked to have a better understanding of how to effectively use the store.js file.  My limited knowledge of how to use this made overcoming challenges in this project a bit more difficult.
